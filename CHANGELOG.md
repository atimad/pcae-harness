## Unreleased

- Transitioned active task from Phase 149O.20L.7O.3F.1: Independent End-to-End Rollback Permission-Boundary Verification to Idle: awaiting next governed phase (post-149O.20L.7O.3F.1); session refreshed and governance continuity revalidated.
- **Phase 149O.20L.7O.3F.1** — Independent End-to-End Rollback
  Permission-Boundary Verification: verification-only phase, zero
  Blocking findings. Independently re-derived (fresh source
  reconstruction, fresh 19-test suite, full existing regression
  re-runs, two-sided Fast Green A/B against an isolated pre-3F
  worktree) that 149O.20L.7O.3F's rollback default-path Permission
  Broker gate is genuinely non-bypassable, fail-closed on DENY/
  broker-failure/malformed-result, does not alter runtime capability,
  does not weaken existing policy via its `EXECUTION_CLASS_MUTATION`
  choice, and does not break any consumer of
  `RollbackExecutionRecord.status`. Zero attributable functional
  regressions. No `src/pcae/` file modified. Recommends
  149O.20L.7O.3G next.
