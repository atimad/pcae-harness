## Unreleased

- **Phase 149O.20L.7O.3H** — PCAE v0.4.1 Release Hardening: prepared a
  frozen, reproducible v0.4.1 release candidate (commit `9869cb65`).
  Version bumped to 0.4.1; release notes written
  (`docs/RELEASE_NOTES_V0_4_1.md`). Two independent clean-clone builds
  produced byte-identical wheel and sdist artifacts using the
  unmodified v0.4.0 reproducible-build process. Clean wheel/sdist
  installs verified (version, CLI, golden path). Installed-artifact
  rollback Permission Broker smoke suite (dry-run/ALLOW/DENY/broker-
  failure/malformed-result/HATP_MANDATORY isolation) passed 15/15 on
  both artifacts. Full Fast Green A/B against an isolated pre-bump
  baseline: zero attributable regressions. v0.4.0 tag/release/assets
  confirmed unchanged. No publication performed; recommends
  149O.20L.7O.3H.1 (publication-only, human-authorization-gated) next.
- **Phase 149O.20L.7O.3G** — Post-Rollback Permission Integration
  Release and Next-Capability Decision: read-only release-scope /
  next-capability decision phase. Confirmed the post-v0.4.0
  production delta is exactly the 3F rollback Permission Broker
  integration (`core/agent.py`, `core/mutation_permission.py`) and
  nothing else; re-verified Permission Broker coverage is complete
  across every currently audited root-mutating command. Freshly
  reassessed Plan A (runtime preflight disclosure, rollback
  readiness/evidence auto-generation) and found neither tightly
  coupled to the shipped rollback integration. Recommended **Option
  A — ship v0.4.1 now**, over Option B (bundle Plan A first) and
  Option C (defer for a larger v0.5.0-scale connected-intelligence
  batch). No production source modified; no version changed; no
  publication performed. Human priority selection required before
  the next phase (release hardening) begins.
- Transitioned active task from Phase 149O.20L.7O.3F.1: Independent End-to-End Rollback Permission-Boundary Verification to Idle: awaiting next governed phase (post-149O.20L.7O.3F.1); session refreshed and governance continuity revalidated.
- **Phase 149O.20L.7O.3F.1** — Independent End-to-End Rollback
  Permission-Boundary Verification: verification-only phase, zero
  Blocking findings. Independently re-derived (fresh source
  reconstruction, fresh 19-test suite, full existing regression
  re-runs, two-sided Fast Green A/B against an isolated pre-3F
  worktree) that 149O.20L.7O.3F's rollback default-path Permission
  Broker gate is genuinely non-bypassable, fail-closed on DENY/
  broker-failure/malformed-result, does not alter runtime capability,
  does not weaken existing policy via its `EXECUTION_CLASS_MUTATION`
  choice, and does not break any consumer of
  `RollbackExecutionRecord.status`. Zero attributable functional
  regressions. No `src/pcae/` file modified. Recommends
  149O.20L.7O.3G next.
