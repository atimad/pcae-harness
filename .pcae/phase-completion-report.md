## Summary

Independently verified PPA-001 v1.0 without trusting Phase 138F's own
conclusions, implementation rationale, or traceability claims. Re-derived
the expected shape of a pre-designation authorization layer directly from
GAC-001 §6/§14 and PGP-001 §4 before reading PPA-001's own text in detail,
then confirmed PPA-001's actual §4–§11 structure matches that independently
derived shape component for component. Cross-checked all GLP-REQ/GAC-REQ/
PGP-REQ citations in PPA-001 against the actual frozen contract text
directly: zero fabricated or misquoted citations, zero orphan obligations.
Ran five direct adversarial interpretation attempts against the "authorize
planning" outcome (designation, automatic accumulation, readiness-
confirmation supersession, execution/assessment role transfer, silent
scope expansion) — all failed to demonstrate a boundary breach. Ran four
direct collapse-direction attempts (authorization→designation, designation→
execution, execution→assessment, assessment→re-authorization circularity)
per the governing prompt's Governance Independence Verification objective —
all failed. Confirmed via `git show --stat` on the Phase 138F commit that
zero pre-existing `docs/contracts/` files were touched. **Verdict: VERIFIED
WITH NON-BLOCKING FINDINGS** — two Non-Blocking findings disclosed (a §6
step-5 wording gap for unfavorable review conclusions, fully closed by
PPA-REQ-022's broader controlling requirement; a SHOULD-strength §9.3
re-confirmation obligation, a disclosed proportionality tradeoff consistent
with existing GAC-REQ-024/PGP-REQ-018 precedent), zero Blocking findings.
No pilot was authorized, designated, or executed. No provision of GLP-001,
GAC-001, PGP-001, or PPA-001 was modified. No production code touched.
Runtime remained Observed / observe / unavailable throughout. See
`docs/PHASE_138G_PILOT_PROPOSAL_AUTHORIZATION_CONTRACT_INDEPENDENT_VERIFICATION.md`.

### In Progress

- (none — no active governed phase)

### Current Runtime State

- **State:** Observed
- **Maximum Capability:** observe
- **Execution Availability:** unavailable

## Governance Results

- **commit_workflow:** governed pcae task new / pcae check / explicit-path commit / pcae task finish for all 138G artifacts; no ungoverned commit outside the task workflow
- **pcae_check:** passed
- **pcae_doctor_task_memory:** clean
- **pcae_health:** healthy
- **pcae_push_check:** clean
- **runtime:** Observed / observe / unavailable, unchanged before and after this phase
- **telegram_runtime:** loaded, unaffected -- no notification/report code path touched by this phase

## Test Results

- **fast_green:** 4391 passed, 0 failed, 105 warnings in 95.31s. Command: python -m pytest -m fast_green -n auto -q.
- **full_suite:** not separately re-run this phase; Fast Green is authoritative for this phase's completion gate, consistent with prior architecture/contract-freeze/verification-phase precedent (137V-138F).
- **report_notification_tests:** no report/notification code path was modified by this phase; not separately re-run.
- **bootstrap_session_reporting_tests:** no bootstrap/session-reporting code path was modified by this phase; not separately re-run.
- **runtime_before_after:** Runtime remained Observed / observe / unavailable throughout; unchanged before and after this phase.
